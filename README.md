â–¶ IPYNB Tools

This project provides a suite of web-based tools for working with Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb files). It allows users to convert notebooks to PDF and to get AI-powered explanations of code cells. The application is built with Flask and utilizes the OpenRouter API for generating code explanations from various large language models.

Features

PDF Conversion: Upload an .ipynb file and receive a pageless PDF document, styled with a "One Dark" theme for readability.

AI Code Explanation:

Upload an .ipynb file and have the code cells explained by your choice of AI models.

Side-by-side view of code and its corresponding explanation.

Support for multiple AI models via the OpenRouter API.

Tabbed interface to easily switch between explanations from different models.

Secure API Key Management: Your OpenRouter API key is stored securely in your session and is not exposed on the client-side.

Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface with a file upload manager, model selection modal, and loading indicators for a smooth experience.

Technology Stack

Backend: Flask, Python

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Notebook Conversion: nbconvert, playwright

AI Integration: requests, aiohttp (for asynchronous API calls to OpenRouter)

Styling: A custom "One Dark" theme for both the web interface and the PDF output.

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

pip for package management

Installation

Clone the repository:

Generated bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


Create a virtual environment:

Generated bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Install the required packages:

Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

(Note: A requirements.txt file would need to be generated from the project's dependencies for this step to work.)

Install Playwright browsers:

Generated bash
playwright install
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
Configuration

The application requires an API key from OpenRouter to use the code explanation feature.

Sign up for an OpenRouter account and obtain your API key.

The application allows you to enter and save your API key directly in the web interface. This key is stored in your session for the duration of your visit.

Usage

Run the Flask application:

Generated bash
python app.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Converting a Notebook to PDF

On the homepage, click on the "Into PDF" link in the navigation bar.

Click the "Click or Drag to Select .ipynb File" area to choose your Jupyter Notebook.

After selecting a file, the "Convert & Preview" button will become active. Click it.

You will be taken to a preview page showing your notebook rendered in HTML.

Click the "Download as PDF" button to save the PDF version of your notebook.

Explaining Code in a Notebook

Navigate to the "Explain Code" page using the link in the navigation bar.

First, you must enter your OpenRouter API key in the designated input field and click "Save Key." This is a required step to fetch the available AI models.

Once the key is saved, you can manage the AI models you want to use for explanations. Click on "Add / Manage Models" to open a modal where you can select from a list of available models.

After selecting your desired models, upload your .ipynb file.

Click the "Explain Code" button. The application will process your notebook, sending each code cell to the selected AI models for an explanation.

The results page will display your notebook's code cells, each followed by the AI-generated explanations. If you selected multiple models, you can switch between their explanations using the tabs at the top of the page.
